Here, my torment trying to training a model for recognize ONLY cats, so they can be "friendly" repellent of their doings in their adventures in a garage.

- the generate_record.py, check those annotations (xml) in 'test' and 'train' folders and build files to train the object detection (cats) model. Each image has its annotation file (xml)
- the requirements.txt file, has my list of python pip packets... THE REAL NIGHTMARE, because on week all works fine, the next, something CHANGES... then the notebook (SOON AVAILABLE) is not compatible... NIGHTMARE
